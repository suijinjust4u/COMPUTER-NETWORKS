### ✅ Exercise 1 & 2 – Network Topologies

In this section, I implemented and simulated the following 6 network topologies:

1. **Peer-to-Peer Topology**
2. **Mesh Topology**
3. **Hybrid Topology**
4. **Ring Topology**
5. **Bus Topology**
6. **Star Topology**

Each topology includes:
- ✅ A working simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer
- 📸 Screenshots of the setup
- 📝 Brief observations (where applicable)

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – for designing and simulating networks
- **GitHub** – for organizing and submitting the assignment

---

## 📌 How to View

1. Open the screenshots folder to view each topology.
2. If provided, download the `.pkt` file and open it in Cisco Packet Tracer to explore the simulation.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This lab helps to understand the structure, benefits, and limitations of different network topologies, reinforcing theoretical concepts through hands-on simulation.
